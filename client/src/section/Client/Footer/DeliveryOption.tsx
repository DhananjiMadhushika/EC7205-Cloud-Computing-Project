              <p className="mb-3 text-justify">Now you can browse through thousands of products on www.Harithaweli.lk at the touch of your fingertips and start ordering. Log in and order online when it suits you and collect from your selected store.</p>
              <p className="mb-3 text-justify">To collect in-store, place your order online as normal and select the "collect in-store" option in the checkout area, instead of entering your delivery details.</p>
              <p className="mb-3 text-justify">Products can be picked up from your chosen store by presenting the order confirmation screen or the confirmation email by Harithaweli, which shows your order reference number.</p>
              <p className="mb-3 text-justify">If Products are being collected in-store, please collect them within 07 days, after Harithaweli informs you that they are ready for collection. If you do not collect the same, then unless you make arrangements with us for late collection, Harithaweli will assume you have cancelled your order. This means Harithaweli may re-sell the Product. Harithaweli may need to verify your identity upon collection.</p>
              <p className="mb-3 text-justify">Please note that there are selected products that are 'only' available to be picked up at the store and these cannot be delivered.</p>
